If the songs.db contains the top 100 songs of a listener in 2018, i would characterize their audio aura using
by calculating the average energy, valence and danceability, High values suggest me that the artist is a upbeat
or joyfull mode, but lower level values show that the song is calm. A listner with energetic and high-valence
tracks might have aura of happy or exited.

However the method oversimplifies listening habits of a person who listense the songs, Average will ignore variety
which can give us more info about that person, what he like to play, and it's context of what he listens, someone
who listens both sad and energetic songs might lie in the neutral mode which is not a good and proper evaluation
that why the averaging is not the accurate method for deciding the audio aura of any person.
